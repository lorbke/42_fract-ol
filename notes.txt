------IMPORTANT------
gcc main.c libmlx42.a -I include -lglfw -L "/Users/$USER/.brew/opt/glfw/lib/"
-Ofast compiling flag to make it much faster
man man 3 math



------REQUIREMENTS-------
mandatory
- global variables forbidden
- Julia and Mandelbrot set
- infinite zooming of the mouse wheel + out zooming
- passed parameters can create different Julia sets
- parameter will also define kind of fractal displayed
- use colors, preferably psychedelic effects, to show depth
- has to be displayed in window
- esc closes the window
- clicking on red cross must close the window and quit in clean way
- mandatory: use of images of minilibx

bonus
- a third fractal set
- zoom following mouse position
- moving view by pressing arrow keys 
- shifting color range



-------FRACTALS--------
- number below 1 ^2 are stable 
- if you add another number 
- black = stable region, other colors = different levels of unstableness
- formula: z^2 * c
	- z is a 2 dimensional complex number (x + yi) (i standing for imaginary)



-------LOGIC-------
- input parsing

- create window
	- key hooks
	- show instructions on screen

- fractal logic
	- color logic

- exit window



// struct to pass around data light width, height etc.
